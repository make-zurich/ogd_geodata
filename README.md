# Geodata for the **City-Forest-Challenge**:

Actually, I couldn't find a complete network dataseta of all existing pathes within the forests. So, there are actually two different data sources:

- 1. [Ground cover data](https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/amtliche-vermessung-bodenbedeckung-dm01avzh24): where it's possible to extract 
    
    - the "Forest Paths" (befestigt.Strasse_Weg.Waldstrasse) and 
    - the "Bicycle and Pedestrian Paths" (befestigt.Strasse_Weg.Velo_Fussweg). Those paths exist also outside of the forests of course. But I haven't cut them already with the forest borders...
    
 - 2. Forest development plan from 2011 (Waldentwicklungsplan 2011) which contains:
    - hiking network of the Canton Zürich and
    - horse riding paths of the Canton Zürich
    --> Both are not containing all the existing forest pathes. I don't know anything about the definition of these pathes...
